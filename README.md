# RVB
The name RVB is short for Router, View, Builder.

It get inspired by architectures like VIPER, [RIBs](https://github.com/uber/RIBs). 
Extracted concept of module manage & intercommunicate from these architectures.

RVB focus on problems that occur between modules.

## View
Module is series of objects composed by view in RVB.(Any modules in domain layer not guide directly in RVB, but you can compose dependencies through Builder.)
Thus the module depend on view's lifecycle.

When the view allocated, associated objects in module instantiate or retained.

Due to this feature, View can use any view base architectures like MVC, MVP, MVVM or [ReactorKit](https://github.com/ReactorKit/ReactorKit).

## Router
Router manage child route paths. It retain child module's `Buildable`s.

Normally router doesn't perform special build process, but child module conversion may be required to fit the current module's view system due to each module is consist independently.

For example, if parent & child module systems are different like that `UIKit` & `SwiftUI` or `RxSwift` & `Combine`,
you may need to convert the child module to fit the current module.
```swift
public protocol ChildControllable: ViewControllable {
    /// Child sequence completed event.
    /// It implemented with `Combine`.
    var completed: AnyPublisher<Void, Never> { get }
}
```

```swift
/// Redefine child module protocol to fit the current module.
protocol ChildControllable: UIViewControllable {
    var disposeBag: DisposeBag { get }

    /// Implemented with `RxSwift`
    var completed: Observable<Void> { get }
}

/// Adapter class to convert module system.
final class ChildControllableAdapter<View: Child.ChildControllable>: UIHostingController<View>, ChildControllable {
    // MARK: - Property
    private let _completed = PublishRelay<Void>()
    var completed: Observable<Void> { _done.asObservable }
    
    private var cancellableBag = Set<AnyCancellable>()

    // MARK: - Initiailzer
    init(view: View) {
        super.init(rootView: view)
        
        // Event adapting
        view.completed
            .sink { [weak self] in self?._completed.accept($0) }
            .store(&cancellableBag)
    }
}
```

```swift
protocol ParentRoutable: Routable {
    func routeToChild(with parameter: ChildParameter) -> ChildControllable
}

final class ParentRouter: ParentRoutable {
    ...
    
    func routeToChild(with parameter: ChildParameter) -> ChildControllable {
        let controllable = childBuilder.build(with: paramter)
        return ChildControllableAdapter(view: controllable)
    }
}
```

## Builder
Builder is responsible for all about modules instanting.

The module can only use builders to instantiate other completely assembled modules.

# Module
Module is series of objects composed by view as mentioned above.

Builder instantiate module with instantiate or injected dependencies. and return `Controllable` that communication protocol between modules.

Router manage child route path using child builders. View request route to Router, it return `Controllable` for module communication(View).

## Dependency & Parameter
```swift
public struct ProductDetailDependency {
    // MARK: - Property
    let productService: ProductServiceable
    
    // MARK: - Initializer
    public init(productService: ProductServiceable) { ... }
}

public struct ProductDetailParameter {
    // MARK: - Property
    let id: String
    
    // MARK: - Initializer
    public init(id: String) { ... }
}

public protocol ProductDetailBuildable: Buildable {
    func build(with parameter: ProductDetailParameter) -> ProductDetailControllable
}

public final class ProductDetailBuilder: Builder<ProductDetailDependency>, ProductDetailBuildable {
    public func build(with parameter: ProductDetailParameter) -> ProductDetailControllable {
        ...
    }
}
```

Builder's components have Dependencies and Parameters.

Dependency is static dependencies for module(like domain layer objects). dependencies that passed through Dependency are managed in Builder scope.

It mean Dependency graph is affected by Builder graph.

Parameter is dynamic dependencies for module(like selected product id). Mostly data generated by the current module.

## Dependency Injection
Dependency injection is performed in `build(with:)` using Dependency & Parameter.

```swift
public final class ProductDetailBuilder: Builder<ProductDetailDependency>, ProductDetailBuildable {
    public func build(with parameter: ProductDetailParameter) -> ProductDetailControllable {
        let viewController = ProductDetailViewController()
        let reactor = ProductDetailViewReactor(
            productService: dependency.productService,
            id: parameter.id
        )
        let router = ProductDetailRouter()
        
        viewController.router = router
        viewController.reactor = reactor

        return viewController
    }
}
```

In this example, dependency(`ProductService`) is injected from parent, but you can instantiate dependency in own module.

And then this case instantiated dependency's top of object graph is Builder.(Object alive until Builder deallocated.)

## Routing
In RVB, again emphasize that module is view. Therefore "routing" means view presenting.

For example there is scenario that `A` route to `B`, `B` send event to parent and `A` route to `C`.

```swift
class AViewController: AControllable {
    ...
    func presentB() {
        guard let viewController = router?.routeToB(with: .init()) else { return }
        
        viewController.event
            .subscribe(onNext: { [weak self] in self?.presentC() })
            .disposed(by: disposeBag)
        
        navigationController?.popToViewController(self, animated: true) // ⚠️
        navigationController?.pushViewController(viewController, animated: true)
    }
    
    func presentC() {
        guard let viewController = router?.routeToC(with: .init()) else { return }
        
        navigationController?.popToViewController(self, animated: true) // ⚠️
        navigationController?.pushViewController(viewController, animated: true)
    }
}
```

The important thing is that `View` should guarantee presenting state about routing.

Because the other architectures manage modules own ways like `Router`'s attach, detach of `RIBs`. but `RVB`'s modules are depend on UI system.

`View` know that how to present own state exactly when child module(view) attached. and in example, when `C` module presenting, `A` know that `B` should be detached.

## Communication
<image src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11141077/166245557-eb9a31d7-e1c8-42a7-b989-ee1652d9f916.png" />

The module can communicate only parent <-> child directly using `Controllable` protocol.

Each module should define `Controllable` protocol for communication. It contain send/receive events.

```swift
public protocol ChildContraollable: ViewControllable {
    var completed: AnyPublisher<Void, Never> { get }
}
```

In this case, child module send completed event that sequence completed.

The protocol's form is free. You can define `delegate pattern`, `Observable`(Rx), `Publisher`(Combine) for send events, and `function`, `Subject` for receive events.

```swift
final class ParentViewController: UIViewController, ParentControllable {
    ...
    func presentChild() {
        let controllable = router?.routeToChild(.init())
        
        // Receive event.
        controllable.completed
            .sink {
                // Do something.
            }
            .store(&cancellableBag)
            
        present(controllable, animated: true)
    }
    ...
}
```

The parent module can receive event through controllable protocol.

## Shared Object
Sometimes module should communicate with far module not direct child.

For example, in sign up flow, `Root` module wait for registration event about `A`(welcome) -> `B`(terms) -> `C`(input basic information) -> `D`(congratulation).

In RVB, the `Root` module should listen event from the module `A` and not the module `D`.

```swift
public protocol AControllable: UIViewControllable {
    var completed: AnyPublisher<Void, Never> { get }
}
```

You can define completed event to all modules, but not recommended.

Bypass event stream through `Builder` & `Dependency`. (A -> B, C, D)

```swift
public struct BDependency {
    let completed: AnyPublisher<Void, Never>
    
    public init(completed: AnyPublisher<Void, Never>) {
        self.completed = completed
    }
}

...
public final class BBuilder: Builder<BDependency>, BBuildable {
    public func build(with parameter: BParameter) -> BControllable {
        let cBuilder = CBuilder(.init(completed: dependency.completed))
        ...
    }
}
```

And inject shared object into the module if needed. 

```swift
public final class DBuilder: Builder<DDependency>, DBuildable {
    public func build(with parameter: DParameter) -> DControllable {
        ...
        let viewModel = DViewModel(completed: dependency.completed)
        ...
    }
}
```

When module `D` job completed, emit event via injected stream. Then you can skip the layers and listen for events.

# Installation
## Swift Package Manager
Package is served, but it's not required. It contain some protocols for namespace, convenience. But it's very simple and less code.

Ultimately, RVB doesn't want to create constraints on development. It just guide.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/wlsdms0122/RVB.git", branch: "main")
]
```
